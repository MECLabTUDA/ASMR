## Introduction
FedPath is a framework for simulating Federated Learning (FL) scenarios in digital pathology. It aims to observe attacking cases on FL such as backdoor or privacy attacks. For this purpose the framework provides multiple datasets, such as Camelyon17 Wilds, ... 
It also provides several aggregation methods like FedAvg, FedAvgM, ...



## Overview

## TODO
- logging
- training methods
- data loaders for the clients (almost done)
- implementing Attacks

- next Step: training method + FedAvg
